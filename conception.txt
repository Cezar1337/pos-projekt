two apps:
- objects + sending data via IP (C++/Eclipse)
- location info reveicer + print location info in console (Python/some IDE)

objects-pos-projekt:
generates a set of objects (ships/planes/cars) as seperate threads, which move (basic version includes one static object) and send their location information via IP to the receiver (basic version involves printing location info in console).

receiver-pos-projekt:
receives location info sent by threads in the "objects" app and prints it out to console/text file.
